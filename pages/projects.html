       <div class="box"> One of the projects I created is called Lightning. It was fun being creative with it, but I struggled to convert it to javascript. Once I was able to do that the sizing and location of my grey cloud got messed up. I eventually was able to fix it by going through my brackets and adding a preload function to help load my image/link. </div>
